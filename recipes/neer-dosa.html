    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Neer Dosa ("water dosa" in Tulu) is a soft, thin, lacy crepe from Coastal Karnataka. Made from fermented rice batter.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup raw rice (Sona Masuri or similar)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated fresh coconut (optional but recommended)</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Water as needed (about 2–3 cups for thin batter)</li>
    <li>Oil or ghee for greasing the pan</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Soak the rice in water for 4–6 hours (or overnight).</li>
    <li>Drain and grind the rice with coconut (if using) and salt to a very smooth paste, adding water gradually.</li>
    <li>Add more water to make a very thin, runny batter (like milk consistency). Let it rest 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat a non-stick pan on medium heat. Lightly grease with oil.</li>
    <li>Pour a ladle of batter in the center and swirl gently to spread thinly (no need to flip).</li>
    <li>Cover and cook 1–2 minutes until edges lift and top looks cooked. Fold and serve hot with coconut chutney or chicken curry.</li>
  </ol>
