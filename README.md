# Odin Recipes

Link: https://aahankotian.github.io/odin-recipes/

A simple recipe website built as the first project in The Odin Project Foundations course (HTML section).

This project demonstrates basic web development skills using **only HTML** (later extended with CSS in the full Foundations path).

### Project Overview
- Main page (`index.html`) with links to individual recipe pages
- Multiple linked HTML files in a `recipes/` folder
- Semantic HTML elements (headings, paragraphs, unordered/ordered lists, images, links)
- Proper file structure and relative paths

### Recipes Included
- [Neer Dosa](recipes/neer-dosa.html) — Thin, lacy Mangalorean rice crepes
- [Chicken Ghee Roast](recipes/chicken-ghee-roast.html) — Fiery, tangy Mangalorean chicken dish roasted in ghee
- [Goli Bajje](recipes/goli-bajje.html) — Crispy, fluffy Mangalorean fritters (also known as Mangalore bonda)

### Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I've practiced and shown:
- Writing valid, semantic HTML5
- Creating hyperlinks between pages
- Organizing content with headings, lists (ingredients & steps), and images
- Using proper folder structure (`recipes/` subfolder)
- Basic Git workflow: init, add, commit, push, and meaningful commit messages
- Writing a README to document the project

### How to View the Project
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:AahanKotian/odin-recipes.git
